I wanted to use some old code I wrote a while ago about training
neural networks but I needed to migrate it under a new version of 
Python and a new version of the compiler. 
I assumed that migrating my old code would not be too painful but 
it cost me day. I don't know if there is a good way to 
maintain some personal toolbox only used only from time to time.
A single framework with a single way to add new features. But it 
is not very convenient with the multiplication of languages
and the maintenane of unused old code. A framework which
allows any kind of language but gluing projects with a script language (Python?):
the issue with this one is you end up write multiple times the same basic 
functionalities (parsing text...) So far, my memory and the unit test I wrote 
were the best help to migrate my old code. It turned out I was able to 
produce a running version of old stuff 
<a href="http://www.xavierdupre.fr/site2013/index_code.html">here</a>.

When I started that, my main issue was, as a teacher, to check
if every piece of code I wrote for my students was still running.
I also wanted to check which one would work on Python 3 (it was made on Python 2.6).
I decided to come up with a solution allowing me to unit test them.
I started to plug the biggest scripts and the new one. But what about
the code embbeded in a latex file... I would surely do different now.

However, while doing that, I discover that non-ascii characters (latin)
are now difficult to handle while writing a C++ extension for Python.
They need to be translated into unicode string. I preferred to remove
any French accent from my old code (in the documentation specified
in <i>boost::python::def</i>) instead of finding a way to keep them.
It will be for the next project.
