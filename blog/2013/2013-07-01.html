To be honest, I hesitated. French, English, I was pissed off by own coding 
(I speak French in that case) but saved by a unit test...
</p>

Function signature are a bit tricky in python because this definition
does not exist. There is only one function and you have to tweak around 
the parameters' type. So... this is an example of a case where unit tests 
were useful to me.
<pre class="prettyprint">
def function_nobody(input) :
    if isinstance (input, list) :
        for line in list :
            # ....
    elif isinstance (input ,str) :
        with open(input, "r", encoding="utf8") as f :
            for line in f :
                # ...
</pre>
So basically, the previous function accepts a file or a list. But I
wanted it to be more generic and to accept iterators:
<pre class="prettyprint">
import collections
def function_nobody(input) :
    if isinstance (input, list) or isinstance (file, collections.Iterable) :
        for line in list :
            # ....
    elif isinstance (input ,str) :
        with open(input, "r", encoding="utf8") as f :
            for line in f :
                # ...
</pre>
I added <i>isinstance (file, collections.Iterable)</i>. But a string falls under 
that condition which made the second case useless. But because I wrote
unit tests, I was able to catch my mistake. I just reverted the two tests:
<pre class="prettyprint">
import collections
def function_nobody(input) :
    if isinstance (input ,str) :
        with open(input, "r", encoding="utf8") as f :
            for line in f :
                # ...
    elif isinstance (input, list) or isinstance (file, collections.Iterable) :
        for line in list :
            # ....
</pre>
And it worked. I confess I did not lose two much time and I would not have lost
any even without unit tests because I would not know my failure. 
However, I don't want to guess how much crazyness 
I could have gone through if one of my scripts fails because of that a month, 
two, three months later. How could I guess it is because of that... 
</p>

Please do unit testing... Ok, it is late, my style might be overdramatic. 
But, please remember this when it is your time to experience one of these
overdramatic scenarii. (I used the latin plural for scenario, don't know
if it works in English).
