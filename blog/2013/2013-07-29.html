When I was young, I was writing code, running, fixing bugs and going on
to something else to code. After I joined my first company, I realized
many people were doing that. There were very different styles of coding,
spaces anywhere, indentation not following a single rule and always 
some resistance to follow one set of rules. I started to work in a company
with various cultures and styles. People usually write code following
the style which is the clearest for them, the easiest to understand for them.
I'm usually skeptical when somebody explains everybody should do this or this
because it makes more sense. As a teacher, I saw too many different logics, 
each of them writing in their own style. And if you do different, it is because
it is more simple that way for you. For example, I usually choose small variables
name for a loop (n, i, t, u) because I read it as a mathematical loop 
(<i>\sigma_{i=1}^n ...</i>). I add a space before semicolon because you do this in French.
One rule I follow is when I modify something written by somebody else: 
I try to follow the same style. I remember some code review which came back
with many comments because my spaces were not good. 
I think there should be a tool for that.

Anyway, when you work on a big project, I'm not sure about the importance 
of the style but I know some tools and practice are unavoidables:
<ul>
<li>unit tests: that should be the first thing you write,</li>
<li>source repository: 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">Git</a> seemed to be one of the best choices,</li>
<li>code review: they make it easy to share pieces of code (see <a href="http://www.reviewboard.org/">ReviewBoard</a>).</li>
<li>automated help generation: it can be useful if it is started soon enough</li>
</ul>
If there are specific guidelines to follow, I usually implement them in unit tests:
you cannot submit a modification if one fails. I prefer an explicit error message
than a document to read explaining how I should code. And every repetitive task should 
be automated.
