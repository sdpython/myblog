I read two blogs about stuff I never remember when I need it.
I often manipulate text file and I know the linux tools are doing quite 
a great job about that. But I never remember the syntax.
This blog post seems to be a good pointer:
<a href="http://www.gregreda.com/2013/07/15/unix-commands-for-data-science/">Useful Unix commands for data science</a>.

The second is about <i>mutex</i> and <i>lock</i>. The second one
is used to synchronize threads among a single application. 
The first one (mutex) is used to synchronize
processes among them (but also threads as a consequence).
And if you want to use mutex all the time because it is convenient,
you should read this blog post first:
