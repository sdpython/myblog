It is not always easy to determine a good size for a module
or a set of modules. Should it be kept as a single bloc
which comes alone or a set of smaller modules? 
It is easier to understand
a smaller modules. It usually limits itself to a small set of 
similar functionalities. However, extending a small module
is faster than starting a new one, it avoids spending too much time
setting up the installation steps, documentation automation,
dependencies with others modules. Small modules grow, especially
if you work late on them on your free time.

<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">pypi</a> makes it simple to install a module
and its dependencies, <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> helps to fork some existing module
which needs to be fixed for a specific usage.
That's why I started to split my own toolbox. Does it worth the effort
knowing I'm the only one to use it? Probably not but, for my teachings,
I think I will not be reluctant anymore
to create a new small project for a specific purpose.

I created or updated three modules:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.xavierdupre.fr/app/pyquickhelper/helpsphinx/index.html">pyquickhelper</a>: functions quickly written to help generating sphinx documentation</li>
<li><a href="http://www.xavierdupre.fr/app/pyensae/helpsphinx/index.html">pyensae</a>: functions used in pratical lessons</li>
<li><a href="http://www.xavierdupre.fr/app/pyrsslocal/helpsphinx/index.html">pyrsslocal</a>: I was using Google Reader and I was reluctant to use
another service, wondering if it would disappear. It could be improved but it is already usable.</li>
</ul>
