Pipelines became a quite popular way to represent a workflow. Many tools such as 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rapidminer/">RapidMiner</a>,
<a href="http://orange.biolab.si/">Orange</a> or 
<a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/">Weka</a> use graphs to represent the 
sequence of processes data follow. Most of the time, between two experiments, 
we just copy paste a previous one, we add or delete a few nodes. After a while,
it becomes uneasy to find out what modifications were made. I was wondering 
how it would be possible
to automate such a task. How to find what modifications were introduced in a graph ?

The following <a href="documents/graph_distance.pdf">paper</a> gives an answer 
to those questions for graphs without cycles. The outcome
is a way to match two graphs altogether and to build an alignment between edges and vertices
from both graphs. This method is based on Levenstein's edit distance.

<tr>
<td>Graph 1</td>
<td>Graph 2</td>
<td>Merged graph</td>

<p>You can find an implementation here: 
<a href="documents/graph_distance.html">graph_distance.py</a>,
<a href="documents/importme.html">importme.py</a>. This algorithm is still very slow and 
could be improved. Maybe for another blog post.
