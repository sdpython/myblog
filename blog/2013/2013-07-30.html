I was wondering why I could not make something work on IExplorer
while it was perfectly working with Firefox and Chrome.
My simple Python web server seemed to get stuck most of the time
by IExplorer (no logs) when I could see all the requests sent by Firefox.
When I was leaving IExplorer, the error message was "interrupted connection".
I finally found the error: IExplorer sends mulitple requests in parallel
and the class <i>HTTPServer</i> does not handle it. To fix that, you need to do
the following:

<pre class="prettyprint">
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer, SimpleHTTPRequestHandler
from socketserver import ThreadingMixIn

class ThreadedServer (ThreadingMixIn, HTTPServer) :
   pass
   
class MyHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def respond(self, status_code):
        self.send_response(status_code)
        self.end_headers()

    def do_GET(self):
        # ...

server = ThreadedServer(('localhost', 8080), MyHandler)
server.serve_forever()
</pre>

</p>
