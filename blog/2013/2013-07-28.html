<!-- SUMMARY BEGINS -->
<p>
When <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader">Google Reader</a> died,
I was reluctant to move to something different. Not because others solutions are
worse or anything like that, but more because I needed to create a new account,
a new password, eventually to pay if the number of blogs I wanted to follow was above a given
threshold. With Google, I did not have to do anything like that. I would argue
that giving everything to a single company which can monitor every single move 
you do on the net is not a good idea.
</p>
<p>
But if I push this reasoning to its extreme, why not having a tool
on my laptop which allows me to read blog posts? That way, I would download myself the 
blog content, I would keep any statistics about my own uage for myself.
And if the design is not good enough, I just have to change it. Well, the only 
argument against that is the time I will need to build that tool (and to maintain it).
</p>
<p>
Well, to be honest, I also did it because I wanted to learn about some
python and javascript figures of programming which I talk about in previous blogs.
The tools looks that way:
</p>

</p>

<!-- SUMMARY ENDS -->
<!-- CUT PAGE HERE -->

<p>
The tool goes through the list of blogs you want to read at will. It stores everything
in a SQLite database, it launches a very simple local server written in Python and launches
the default browser to get the previous page. On the top of the page, you can see the following
images:
</p>
<p>
<img src="documents/rss_reader_ico.png" />
</p>
<p>
A click on them will let you know:
<ul>
<li>the list of all posts,</li>
<li>the list of blogs which publish many posts a day</li>
<li>the list of blogs which publish less than a post a day</li>
<li>the list of blogs which published during the last day</li>
<li>the list of blogs which published during the last wek</li>
</ul>
The display can be easily changed, lists are created by python script inserted in a HTML
page:
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;div class="divpostsext" id="divpostsext" onscroll="savePosition('divpostsext')"&gt;
&lt;script type="text/python"&gt;
for post in dbrss.enumerate_posts(blog_selection = blog_selected, 
                                  post_selection = post_selected,
                                  specific       = search,
                                  first          = 20) :
    action = "__link__"
    if search != None : action += "?search=%s" % search
    print (post.html(action = action, extended = True))
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
</p>
<p>
<b>Installation:</b> it requires a python module I wrote 
<a href="http://www.xavierdupre.fr/site2013/index_code.html">pyhome3</a> 
(see also <a href="http://www.xavierdupre.fr/app/pyhome3/helpsphinx/index.html#dependencies">dependencies</a>).
Then, it just needs to create a shortcut on the desktop:
<pre class="prettyprint">
C:\Python33\pythonw.exe C:\Python33\Lib\site-packages\pyhome3\pyhome3_gui.py
</pre>
It should work on Linux but I did not test every thing.
</p>
<p><b>Usage:</b> when you execute the link, you will see a window:
</p>
<img src="documents/rssreader0.png" />
<p>
You need to choose the function <i>rss_update_run_server</i>.
</p>
<img src="documents/rssreader0b.png" />
<p>
You need to fill two parameters: the list of blogs you want to follow and the file
(SQLite format) the function will fill with the downloaded data. For example:
</p>
<img src="documents/rssreader1.png" />
<p>
The list of blogs is defined by an XML file which uses Google Reader dump format:
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;opml version="1.0"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Xavier subscriptions in Google Reader&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;outline title="libraries" text="libraries"&gt;
            &lt;outline text="The Overview Project"
                title="The Overview Project" type="rss"
                xmlUrl="http://overview.ap.org/feed/" htmlUrl="http://overview.ap.org"/&gt;
        &lt;/outline&gt;
        &lt;outline text=":: S.I.Lex ::" title=":: S.I.Lex ::" type="rss"
            xmlUrl="http://scinfolex.wordpress.com/feed/" htmlUrl="https://scinfolex.wordpress.com"/&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/opml&gt;
</pre>
It starts displaying many information you do not care about (except if there is an error 
which should not happen).
<pre class="prettyprint">

It ends by launching the default brownser and you can start reading blog posts. You need
to click on <i>Cancel or Leave</i> to terminate the server when you are done. When you come back
the next day, you will not have to type again the parameters.
</p>
<p>
<b>Next steps:</b> I have some ideas but maybe not enough time to implement them.
Some features are missing on the webpage (the title of the blog next to each post).
I would like to compute some statistics on the background, add a link to make the server 
update the blog. For the time being, you can do that yoursel by looking at the database 
it creates to store the post. A tool such as 
<a href="http://www.yunqa.de/delphi/doku.php/products/sqlitespy/index">SQLiteSpy</a> will 
easily allow you to query the database.
</p>
<p>
The code is now available at <a href="https://github.com/sdpython/pymmails">pymmails</a>.
