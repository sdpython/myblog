When I try to avoid coding and to use existing tools,
I usually decompose my problem in smaller ones I think people
already solved. I usually skip the documentation until I find an example 
for each of them. That's how I proceed to use 
<a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a>. I imagine how I would 
do it using SQL and I try to write it using this module. My
problem was the following one:
</p>
<pre class="brush: sql">
SELECT location, MIN(commute) AS minc, MAX(commute) AS maxc FROM data
</pre>
<p>
Which I was able to solve this way (after a couple of tries
and a glass of wine to avoid losing my temper):
</p>
<pre class="brush: py">
data = [ 
    { "name":"hugo", "location":"paris", "commute":55 },
    { "name":"marcel", "location":"paris", "commute":45 },
    { "name":"jack", "location":"lyon", "commute":25 },    
    { "name":"hugo", "location":"lyon", "commute":20 },  ]

df = pandas.DataFrame(data)

agg = df.groupby ( "location", as_index=False).agg ( 
            { "commute": [ ("minc",min), ("maxc", max) ] } ) # first glass of wine
print (agg)
</pre>
<p>
Then, I wanted to write this:
</p>

<pre class="brush: sql">
SELECT A.*, B.minc, B.maxc FROM data AS A INNER JOIN ( 
        SELECT location, MIN(commute) AS minc, MAX(commute) AS maxc FROM data) AS B 
</pre>
<p>
Which I converted into after a second glass of wine:
</p>
<pre class="brush: py">
agg = df.groupby ( "location", as_index=False).agg ( 
            { "commute": [ ("minc",min), ("maxc", max) ] } )
agg.columns = ["minc", "maxc"]  # the second glass of wine
join = df.merge (agg, left_on="location", right_on = "location")
print (join)
</pre>
<p>
But you could write it that way:
</p>

<pre class="brush: py">
agg = df.groupby ( "location").agg ( 
            { "commute": [ ("minc",min), ("maxc", max) ] } )
agg.columns=["minc","maxc"]
join = df.merge (agg, left_on="location", right_index= True)
print (join)
</pre>
<p>
Last precision: the instruction <i>agg.columns=["minc","maxc"]</i> rename
the column name. However, it works in this case just because
we aggregated only one column (<i>commute</i>). When
several columns are aggregated, the order of the column
in the resulting matrix is not always the same. So do not do the following:
</p>
<pre class="brush: py">
def sums(l) : return ",".join(l)
    
agg = df.groupby ( "location", as_index=False).agg (
            { "name":sums, 
              "commute": [ ("minc",min), ("maxc", max) ] } )
agg.columns=["name","minc","maxc"]  # glass of whisky
</pre>

<p>
I often get frustrated about tools, it takes me so many tries to
get the data the way I want before I start working on an algorithm using them.
Then, you try to apply it on a much bigger dataset and it fails
for a couple of bad rows which cannot be parsed because 
of a string including tabs. After, I got the accent problem... 
I hate those days.
