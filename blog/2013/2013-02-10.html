<!-- SUMMARY BEGINS -->
Some algorithms, you cannot avoid implementing them a couple of times
every year. When you work for a search company, you always deal with text.
You use regular expressions almost every week. The edit distance is one of 
these algorithms you never find in the company's wiki or not in the 
programming language you expect. The code references some weird assembly
you don't need and don't want. Or simply, this time, you don't need 
the distance but the path between the two sequences.
You expect to find this algorithm to be somewhere present, accessible, somewhere
you don't have to look for, somewhere on the company's wiki. 
But surprisingly, everybody did his own, not documented, including unexpected
paramters. I wish I could even keep myself some versions I made but 
I often implemented the edit distance in a way that it was faster 
for my specific needs at that time. Even for this blog 
(<a href="xd_blog.html?date=2013-01-25">How to normalize an edit distance ?</a>), 
I did it again. I remember one time doing it to prove my students the edit
distance was another versions of the shortest path in a graph. I did it again
today: <a href="documents/edit_distance_alignment.html">edit_distance_alignment.py</a>.
Maybe it will be the last time?
