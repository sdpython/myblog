When you work for a big company, you have the opportunity to observe 
many coding styles and spirits. I will not talk about coding 
style, it appears mine is not perfect since I never learnt
programming in a school but only by myself. I put spaces
before semicolon or brackets because it fits the way I write in
French. But coding spirit is something else. Some developers 
goes fast, develop an idea as fast as they can, show it works and...
</p>
<p>
That's the big question: what happens next? You can continue
based on the existing code which is very tempting to avoid losing
the momentum of your ideas. Usually, it happens that your
development speed decreases as you face issues, bugs, design limitations. 
The code is most of the time not enough unit tested, 
it has very small documentation and memory fades away. Code review
was not that used and the design did not benefit from too many insights.
</p>
<p>
Some people might say that you should stop, think
again about the whole thing and make it right this time. A good
design never fails... I would say design always faces a time
when it reaches its limitations just because research moved forward,
needs changed.
My suggestion is to revisit the code from time to time and 
not to hesitate holding development just to redesign some parts.
A kind of regular code cleaning. It also adresses the goal of not 
completely losing sight of an old code as you revisit it.
</p>
<p>
However, the first approach is not bad when you do research.
You are only interest in proving an idea is wworking 
not in maintaining the code which helped to prove it. 
And it perfectly makes sense... until somebody asks you
to continue and develop the new features you promised.
You then continue to develop as crazy, show the beginning
of the new features. You are successful. My recommendation 
at this stage of the development: leave the project
as it is and be as successful somewhere else. The new team
in charge will take some time to fully understand what you did,
and will probably decide to make some deep changes which will
significantly slow down the software development (at least
compare to the previous team).
</p>
<p>
There are so many ways to develop. But sometimes, I think it is 
like playing chess, some developers think further. You
do not understand why they are playing this move... but
it works ten moves later. The only issue is a chess games does not 
last more than a day when developing game can last
many years.
