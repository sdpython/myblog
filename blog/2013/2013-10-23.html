I migrated over Windows 8.1 and I realized my version of 
pythonnet for Python did not work anymore. I got the following
error:

<pre class="prettyprint">
ImportError: dynamic module does not define init function (PyInit_clr)
</pre>

I did not really try to understand but I knew I had to access the sources first because 
the official website of <a href="http://pythonnet.sourceforge.net/">pythonnet</a> 
does not provide any version for python 3.x. 
So I looked for pythonnet on github, I found 
<a href="https://github.com/renshawbay/pythonnet">this</a>. 
I got the sources which did not compile on the first try unless 
I apply the three following modifications:
<ul>
<li>Download <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page">Mono</a> and 
<a href="http://www.nunit.org/">NUnit</a>, and replace <i>using Mono.Unix</i> by <i>Mono.Posix</i> 
(+ adding <i>Mono</i> and <i>Mono.Posix</i> as references),</li>
<li>Add the constant <i>PYTHON33</i> on every Project and every version,</li>
<li>Remove the definition of the constant <i>DEBUG_PRINT</i>.</li>
</ul>

After the compilation completed (on Windows 8.1 + Visual Studio 2012, 2013), 
I could use the two files <i>clr.pyd</i> and <i>Python.Runtime.dll</i> the same way.
There were some others modifications I do not remember exactly. Anyway, my version
is located here <a href="https://github.com/sdpython/pythonnet">sdpython/pythonnet</a>.
