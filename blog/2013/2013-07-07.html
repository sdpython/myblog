I was using MinGW on Windows to build a Python extension including C++ code.
The 32bit mode was working fine and I was using the following command line:
<pre class="prettyprint">
python setup.by build --compiler=mingw32
</pre>

I thought it would be easy to run it with the Python 64 bit version. No change
would be required. I was a little bit over confident.

<pre class="prettyprint">

I decided to switch to Visual Studio Express 2012 to build my extension.
but I went through some error related to the file <b>vcvarsall.bat</b> because
Python was not able to find the file <b>vsvars64.bat</b> (for one very good
reason, it does not exist). I read some blogs where people suggest to reinstall
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/france/visual-studio/essayez/express.aspx">Visual Studio Express</a>
but I did not remember the setup asking me anything about options.
When I checked the folder of Visual Studio, I found the following file
<b>vcvarsx86_amd64.bat</b>. Then, after some research (stubborness is mandatory for those parts)
and some tweaks, I discovered two mistakes in the package <b>distutils</b>. 
They need to be fixed in the file <b>msvc9compiler.py</b>:
<ul>
<li> The file uses the version Visual Studio used to compile Python (2010),
      which is not the version I used, so I manually updated the function 
      <b>get_build_version</b> to get:
      
        <pre class="prettyprint">
            if majorVersion >= 6:
                # pick on of the following line
                majorVersion = 11 # VS 2012
                majorVersion = 12 # VS 2013
                majorVersion = 14 # VS 2015
                return majorVersion + minorVersion          
        </pre>
            
    Not the best but it works.
</li>
<li> The second modification is at the beginning of the same file which contains:
    
        <pre class="prettyprint">
            PLAT_TO_VCVARS = {
                'win32' : 'x86',
                'win-amd64' : 'amd64',
                'win-ia64' : 'ia64',
            }            
        </pre>
            
      The flag <b>amd64</b> must be replaced by <b>x86_amd64</b>.
</li>
</ul>
After the two modifications, it was working fine with the following command line:
<pre class="prettyprint">
python setup.by build --compiler=msvc --plat-name=win-amd64
</pre>
And I understood why it was failing without any mysterious new installation.
I checked about 64 bit version of MinGW but it looked a longer path than 
the one I chose. Who knows?
You will find some others details 
<a href="http://www.xavierdupre.fr/app/pyhome3/helpsphinx/pyhome/pyhome3/srcpyhome/module_c/import_c_module.html">here</a>.
I wrote a function which import a module written in one single C++ file. 
If the module does not exist, it compiles it <i>inplace</i>.
</p>
<p>
As a conclusion, I would say it was difficult to find the proper instructions.
Maybe the number of documents related to that issue has increased,
or the search engines I used were not able to give me the answer. 
All I know is I do not want to go through that again even if I know there will 
be a next time when I update Python or when I change my laptop. I hope next time
I face that problem, search engines will show me my own page.
