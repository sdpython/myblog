My students often struggle to debug their programs 
when two or three students need to synchronize their versions.
A good way to avoid wasting too much time is to use a tool to keep
track of the modifications such as <a href="https://github.com/">github</a>.
It then becomes easy to synchronize multiple versions.
</p>
<p>
However, students still need to debug the program after a synchronization.
A good practice is to write unit tests. Every time, you write a complex function
or an easy one, a unit test should be written to ensure its behaviour
will not change after many changes. But it means to add a file, to spend
some time to do it right, and to frequently run all the unit tests.
This is usually too painful when the project will only last a couple of months.
Plus, you usually commit yourself to do it only after you went through the nightmare of 
debugging once.
</p>
<p>
Last but not least, my students usually do not add documentation to their code.
Most of the time, they do not need it because the project is too short to
lose track of the modifications and too small to not know it completely.
Maybe another reason is because they cannot see a compiled version of the 
documentation. The best way is to use Sphinx ut using it means spending 
a couple of hours at least (a lot of more if you do it for the first time).
Documentation can also be used to navigate through the program.
</p>
<p>
For those reasons, I made a kind of template for a Python module. It includes
an easy mechanism to add a unit test and to run it. It generates with the documentation
with no change and it also generated a setup (gz, exe) with no change either.
You can get it here: <a href="http://www.xavierdupre.fr/site2013/index_code.html#code">Pieces of codes, libraries</a> (section <i>Code</i>). 
After you downloaded it, a page gives the short list of instructions to tweak the 
template in order to make it yours:
