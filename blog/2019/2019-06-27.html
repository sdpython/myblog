A bug. One more. I read the documentation of the fonction. 
It hardly describes what it does. This long paragraph is probably clear 
for its author but still kind of obscur to me. When i understand it, it tells 
me that what i wrote is partially wrong but i wrote so many lines that I'm 
puzzled about which is wrong and which is right. So what... 
i go on github to see where this exception may have been raised and 
then i realize this information i need is not there unless i expand 
the error message with what i need. But then i'll to recompile and 
that cost 30 minutes on my poor ugly laptop. So what... I skip it unable 
to convince myself to freeze my machine for that much of time 
and drink coffee for half an hour which is much more than the small 
quantity that would keep me awake for ever. So i tried poking with 
parameter almost randomly - what i kindly oppose when my students 
do it - to find out the combination which works out of the many 
combinations  Hermione - I'm pretty sure - would have been happy to 
solve. And finally when i find, all seem logical in a way i kindly 
disagree with all the non informative error messages i got all along doing it...

I need to be drunk before this fully uninteresting task gets up 
to my brain, before this part of my body realizes whatever i do 
practice is always what I need not to feel the pain of struggling 
against such nonsense, before it realizes that coding is one among 
the few kinds of shared art, something people may do with other 
people just because they never get somebody to tell them it was 
so beautiful that it deserves to be hanged on their wall.

Whatever, I'm still at that bug, skipping the documentation which 
does not make sense to me tonight and directly going to what causes 
my picasso face, a kind of disorganized puzzled face. Anyway, 
I'm in the CODE, the open source code and I feel happier just 
because the code is precise and is not outdated. Writing documentation 
reminds me the summary exercise I did in the preparatory school 
to Grandes Ecoles. A good documentation takes time. Otherwise, a link 
to the code is just what i need.
