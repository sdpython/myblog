First time in my life when whatever I do is open source
and on GitHub. I remember when I left my first company,
it was quite annoying to leave everything I contributed to
behind me and not being able to look what it became from
time to time. It is like coming back to your hometown,
it is a place you know very well and quite hard to leave
for ever.

I made a page for all the
<a href="http://www.xavierdupre.fr/opensource/index.html">open source projects</a>
I work on. Most of them are my own, 
a couple of them contains the teaching I do,
some others automate the publishing of the first one,
some help me during my daily life,
the last ones are Microsoft's one.
