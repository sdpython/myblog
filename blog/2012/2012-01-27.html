I grew up in France, I studied statistics but I only heard the term 
<i>p-Value</i> for the first time a couple of years ago when I started 
to work on search engines. 
I was used to hear about confidence intervals at 95%. 
But we are talking about the same thing as explained 
<a href="documents/pvalues.pdf">here</a>.

<p>
It goes on
with the specific case of a binomial law. Assuming we want to determine whether or not two
binomial laws are significantly different, how many observations we need to get the p-value under
a given threshold.
