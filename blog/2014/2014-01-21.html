I usually use <a href="http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html">SciTE</a> when
programming Python. It is simple and fast. Plus, I usually do not 
use a debugger. I sometimes use <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>
but the shortcuts are different and I never really tried to change them.
I once tried <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pyscripter/">PyScripter</a>
but the project seems to be intermittently maintained.

<p>
I recently tried the free version of <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a>
and it is very to use. Create a project is not difficult, adding existing files too.
And it was possible to change the shorcuts as I wanted. One feature I liked was the 
easy installation of <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools">setuptools</a> and 
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/">pip</a>.
The professional version offers
support for <a href="http://www.django-fr.org/">django</a>.

I tried <a href="http://eric-ide.python-projects.org/index.html">The Eric Python IDE</a>
a long time ago but it seemed too complex for my needs.
<a href="http://pytools.codeplex.com/">Python Tools for Visual Studio</a>
is a also nice integration, interesting for big projects.
I'm surprised to see features such as creating a file <tt>setup.py</tt>,
creating a sphinx project, using <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cx_Freeze">cx_Freeze</a>.
I'm wondering if I'm not going to switch from an editor to another one
depending on what features I will need for the current project.
To conclude, if you want to use a tablet, you can use 
<a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/">Python Anywhere</a>.
You can check other alternative on 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_integrated_development_environments#Python">Wikipedia</a>. 
Don't forget to check the date of the latest release first. Older than a year is not a good sign.

If you do machine learning a lot, it might be interested to 
use an environment designed for that purpose such as 
<a href="http://winpython.sourceforge.net/">WinPython</a>.
It includes <a href="https://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/">Spyder</a>
which has been updated to Python 3.3 last year.
It also includes IPython with the notebook which makes it
easier to test some of the steps I went through
in this previous blog
