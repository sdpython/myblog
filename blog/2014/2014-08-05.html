<!-- SUMMARY BEGINS -->

<p>
Autocompletion is a nice feature quite useful when typing very long names.
It is implemented by modules such as 
<a href="http://ipython.org/">IPython</a>, 
<a href="http://bpython-interpreter.org/">bpython</a> or
<a href="http://www.dreampie.org/">DreamPie</a>. 
I'm quite a big fan of a the first one, the notebooks to be precise.
However, it did not seem quite 
easy to add my custom autocompletion.
I tried some search queries but I was only able to find
<a href="http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/config/integrating.html">Integrating your objects with IPython</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPEP-11:-Tab-Completion-System-Refactor">IPEP 11: Tab Completion System Refactor</a>.

<p>
So I followed the idea mentioned on the first page. I created 
kind of fake classes. They do not do anything but populating
the dictionary <tt>__dict__</tt> so that the information
appears when <tt>tab</tt> is pressed.
So I just did that for files except I had to replace
some characters, normal for a filename but unexpected for a variable name.
Based on that, I wrote some code 
(<a href="http://www.xavierdupre.fr/app/pyquickhelper/helpsphinx/_modules/ipythonhelper/kindofcompletion.html#AutoCompletion">here</a>)
to populate a class with members very close to file names:
</p>

<pre class="brush: py">
from pyquickhelper import AutoCompletionFile
d = AutoCompletionFile(".")
</pre>

<p>
As a result, when pressing <tt>tab</tt>, file names will appear:
</p>

<p>
I replaced <tt>"."</tt> by <tt>"_"</tt> but it is quite easy to use.
By adding <tt>._</tt>, you get the real path.
</p>

<pre class="brush: py">
os.listdir(d.sphinxdoc.source._)
</pre>
