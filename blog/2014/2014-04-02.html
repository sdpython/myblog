Python does not offer all the functionalities in one module, you
need to look for them sometimes. In my case, I was looking
for a statistical test on coefficients obtained with a linear regression.
The module I was looking for is <a href="http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/">statmodels</a>.
While looking for that, I found this interesting blog 
<a href="http://glowingpython.blogspot.fr/">Glowing Python</a>. But I finally
decided to switch to R where I know for sure I would find what I need.
And because I'm not fluent in R, I need something like that :
<a href="http://www.statmethods.net/index.html">StatMethods</a>.
