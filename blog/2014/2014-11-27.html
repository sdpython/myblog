When you look for a bug, it could fail anywhere so you make assumptions on what you think
is working and what could be wrong. I lost of couples of hours because I made the wrong one.
I was preparing my teachings and I stored my data using Python serialization instead of json.
That way, I could just use <tt>eval( string_serialized )</tt>. It already worked locally 
and on a first cluster hadoop when this instruction was embedded in python 
script. A PIG script was then calling it through streaming. 
I then tried the same instruction and it failed many times until I check this line was 
involved. And why? The error message was just not here
to tell me anything about what happened. The script was just crashing.
I suspect the line was just too long So, I'll do that another way.
My first assumption were the schema I used in my Jython script. I finally chose 
to save that issue by considering only strings. I commented out 
line after line until this one out finally made my job work.
That's the part of computing science I don't like. Long, full of guesses,
impossible to accomplish without an internet connexion to dig into the vast amount of 
recent and outdated examples. And maybe in a couple of months, this issue will be solved
by a simple update.

This night never happened. That's what I'll keep in mind. This night never happened.
