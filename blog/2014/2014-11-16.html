Sometimes I need to type some credentials to access a remote machine 
from my notebook. I could write them in a cell but then I would need
to remove them from the notebook to avoid sharing them by negligence.
I was using a simple fonction showing a window tkinter, a pop up. But this
solution only works if the notebook server is local. When it is remote, 
the pop up windows appears on the remote machine and I cannot see it.

IPython allows javascript functions to execute some Python instructions
which impact the workspace. All I had to do was to print a form in the page with
some javascript. The result can be found here :
