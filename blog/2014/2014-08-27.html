I used to work on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Improv">Lotus Improv</a>
to compute predictions based on retirement systems. The mortality table was
modelled as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cube">data cube</a>.
The software was quite intuitive and easy to use. It was just a cube,
a way to visualize data aggregations and formulas to populate cells beyond the current date 
(= the prediction).
When I looked for a replacement for this software, I was surprised to discover
many dead initiatives included Improv itself. I guess not so many people need that kind
of functionalities even though some people find it very useful.
One possible replacement (and still alive) is <a href="http://www.quantrix.com/">Quantrix</a>.
But to avoid the same end of many other softwares, the tool provides many more functionalities
other than just being able to visualize the data.
I was curious to see if somebody started something with Python. I found
<a href="https://github.com/Stiivi/cubes">cubes</a> and 
<a href="https://github.com/jjmontesl/cubesviewer">cubesviewer</a>. I did not try yet but I'll keep
that in mind.
