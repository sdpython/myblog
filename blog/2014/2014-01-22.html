<!-- SUMMARY BEGINS -->

<p>
When my student have their exams, I receive many emails with 
their solution attached to them. I avoid downloading them
all because it is manual. However, a couple of days ago, 
I thought it might be useful if I write the tool which does
it for me (I'm still refusing to do it manually).
I ended up writing a Python module called 
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymmails">pymmails</a>.
To get the email from my students, I just had to 
execute the following script:
</p>
<pre class="brush: py">
from pyquickhelper import fLOG
from pymmails import MailBoxImap
fLOG(OutputPrint=True)
user = "your.email"
pwd = "password"
server = "imap.your_provider.ext"
box = MailBoxImap(user, pwd, server)
box.login()
box.dump_html(folder="students_exam", pattern='FROM "ensae" SINCE 1-Dec-2013')
box.logout()
</pre>
<p>
All the attachments were in a single folder.
I hope I'll remember my own trick next year
or maybe I'll use 
<a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/">jinja2</a>
or even
<a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/">pelican</a>
to make it better.

Among others things, it was not straight forward to write this code.
I had to gather some piece of information such as:
<ul>
<li>Class <tt>imaplib.IMAP4</tt> for <a href="http://www.orange.fr/">orange</a>,
    class <tt>imaplib.IMAP4_SSL</tt> for <a href="http://www.gmail.com/">gmail</a>.</li>
<li>You need to select a folder first before searching:
        <pre class="brush: py">
        M = IMAP (server)
        M.login(login, pwd)
        M.select(qfold, readonly=True)   # qfold in M.list() (after some cleaning)
        typ, data = M.search(None, 'ALL')
        a_message = M.fetch(...)
        M.close()
        </pre>
        </li>
<li>To fetch the body and the text: <tt>t,data = M.fetch(num, '(BODY[HEADER])')</tt></li>
<li>To fetch everything: <tt>t,data = M.fetch(num, '(RFC822)')</tt></li>
<li>Every field (including attachments names) of the header can be encoded in a different encoding. The decoding happens with
        a different function: <tt>text, encoding = email.header.decode_header(value)[0]</tt>
        (the encoding is noticeable with <tt>=?</tt>, the encoding can start in
        the middle of the string if somebody pressed <tt>Reply</tt> and modified the subject).</li>
<li>The way you can search emails is described here: <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3501#page-49">IMAP Protocol</a></li>
</ul>
