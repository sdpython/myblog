<p>
The new version Python 3.4 was just released. One interesting
change is that modules <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip">pip</a>
and <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools">setuptools</a>
are now part of the distribution. That's a relief.
Every module which does not requires C++ compilation
can now be installed using <tt>pip install [module]</tt>
without any extra step. On Windows, the others modules 
can still be installed from this page:
<a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/">Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages</a>
unless you want to use Visual Studio to compile them. In this
case, I recommend reading this page:
<a href="http://www.confusedbycode.com/articles/compiling-python-modules.html">Module Madness: installing Python modules on Windows</a>.
</p>

<p>
Among the unexpected changes, the instruction <tt>#coding:latin-1</tt>
is not allowed anymore. The C++ API changed a little bit. It made me make 
a change to pythonnet to compile it with Python 3.4:
<a href="https://github.com/sdpython/pythonnet/commit/de45c55c95ca1d003cb3033824625bb42103ecbe">pythonnet migration to Python 3.4</a>.
Hopefully, the installation of executables (sometimes after looking for them)
could become easier with <a href="http://pythonwheels.com/">Python Wheels</a>.
Maybe <a href="http://winpython.sourceforge.net/">WinPython</a> will follow soon.
</p>

<p>
However, I recommend to wait a little bit before switching. I had some weird behaviour with
matplotlib: no failure with Python 3.3 but a failure while drawing a second graph with Python 3.4.
