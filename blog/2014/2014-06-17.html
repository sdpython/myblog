I was looking for a way to download a file from <a href="SourceForge">http://sourceforge.net/</a>
with the following code:
</p>

<!-- SUMMARY BEGINS -->

<pre class="brush: py">
url = "something on source forge"
req = urllib.request.Request(url)
u = urllib.request.urlopen(req)
bin = u.read()
u.close()
with open("something.zip","wb") as f : f.write(bin)
</pre>

<p>
It failed due to redirections. 
Doing it myself or trying to look for some module doing the job.
Every query I tried on a search engine about getting a file from 
<i>SourceForge</i> in Python gave me links to Python projects on hosted 
on <i>SourceForge</i>. Not exactly what I was looking for.
So...
</p>

<p>
I tried some search queries including redirection 
and after a couple of them
I found the following module <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/">requests</a>
which made it a lot easier:
</p>

<pre class="brush: py">
req = requests.get(url, allow_redirects = True, stream=True)
bin = req.raw.read()
with open("something.zip","wb") as f : f.write(bin)
</pre>

<p>
I guess the module <a href="http://urllib3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">urllib3</a>
could also do the trick but I did not try it.
