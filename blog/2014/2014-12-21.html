<!-- SUMMARY BEGINS -->

<p>
It is usually quite annoying to develop a web application
and to test the code by just running it and checking it produces what you expect
for a given request. It would be more simple to write a function
which launches the web application on a local machine and retrieves
the content of a given page. That describes what a unit test could be used for.
</p>
<p>
I used <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> to do it.
I hesitated to choose <a href="http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html">bottle</a>
but I needed to be able to shutdown the application by some means.
I found a way for Flask faster than for Bottle. That's why I used the first one.
</p>

<!-- CUT PAGE HERE -->

<p>
The code the wep application can be found here: 
<a href="https://github.com/sdpython/ensae_teaching_cs/blob/master/src/ensae_teaching_cs/td_1a/simple_flask_site.py">simple_flask_site.py</a>.
The first trick is to be able to shutdown the service:
</p>
<pre class="bursh :py">
def shutdown_server():
    func = request.environ.get('werkzeug.server.shutdown')
    if func is None:
        raise RuntimeError('Not running with the Werkzeug Server')
    func()

@app.route('/shutdown/', methods=['POST'])
def shutdown():
    shutdown_server()
    return Text2Response('Server shutting down...')
</pre>
<p>
And you do it with:
</p>
<pre class="brush: py">
import requests
c = requests.post( "http://localhost:8025/shutdown/")
</pre>
<p>
The second trick is after the web application has started, another thread must
continue to query the website. So we run the website within a thread:
</p>
<pre class="brush: py">
from ensae_teaching_cs.td_1a.simple_flask_site import app
th = FlaskInThread(app, host="localhost", port=8025)
th.start()  # just run app.run
# ... any kind of test
requests.post( "http://localhost:8025/shutdown/")
</pre>

</body>
