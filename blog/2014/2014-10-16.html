<p>
I'm in a train unable to access internet and I thought I could
do something without it. But what I do is not an algorithm,
it is a simple functionality which requires a function I use
from time to time. It is Python, so I type
<tt>help (function)</tt>. I understand what it says but I'm 
unable to guess what value I need and there is no example.
I know I could easily get that by using a search engine
<tt>python function example</tt>. But I can't so I prefer to give up
just because I know I could spend a lot of time guessing
this particular value I don't know. I don't know how to
program without internet anymore.
