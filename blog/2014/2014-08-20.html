<!-- SUMMARY BEGINS -->

<p>
Python is interpreted at runtime. Variables types are discovered during the 
execution. That is also why it is so slow. It is difficult to anticipate
what the type of variable will be even though projects such as 
<a href="http://pypy.org/">pypy</a> or <a href="http://nuitka.net/">nuitka</a>
aims at compiling a python script by doing so.
They must do type infering.
Python 3 has introduced a nice feature which helps doing that:
<a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/">function annotations</a>.
It specifies a static type to the parameters and/or the returned result.
By doing this, it is easier to check types at runtime 
(with module <a href="https://github.com/prechelt/typecheck-decorator">typecheck-decorator</a>):

<pre class="brush: py">
from typecheck import typecheck

@typecheck
def p(i:int) :
    print('hello',i)

@typecheck
def inc(x) -> int :
    return x+1

a = p(5)    # no error
a = p(5.5)  # error

inc(1)      # no error
inc(1.1)    # error
</pre>

<p>
You can also check complex types such as dictionary of string.
</p>

<pre class="brush: py">
from typecheck import typecheck
import typecheck as tc

@typecheck
def count(text:str)->tc.dict_of(str, int):
    words = text.split()
    res = { }
    for w in words:
        res [ w ] = res.get(w,0) + 1
    res[None] = 0  # will cause an error while checking the returned value
    return res
    
count("a b c a")  # raises an exception
</pre>

<p>
The other initiative based on the annotations is <a href="http://www.mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a>.
It is a static compiler which leverages annotations to avoid
infering types.
It is scheduled to be released next year.
