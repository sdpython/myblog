<title>Fix table of contents in a Notebook</title>

When I have a long notebook, I find it difficult to navigate through it.
Maybe I should not do that. However, some outputs are quite long sometimes and the page
gets longer. I usually put a table of contents at the beginning but it means I need to
go back to the top of the page anytime I want to go to a specific section. That's why I 
tried a table of contents in a section <tt>div</tt> with an absolute position
(the notebook is <a href="http://www.xavierdupre.fr/app/pyquickhelper/helpsphinx/notebooks/exemple_of_fix_menu.html">here</a>).
It works nice even if the mix between markdown and HTML gives weird results sometimes.
The only drawback is the conversion of the notebook into HTML or rst. 
The table of contents shows up at the top of the page at the expected place
but disappears after the page was scrolled down.
