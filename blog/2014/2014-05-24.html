<p>
Implementing graph algorithm on map/reduce is still a challenge.
But maybe because it is a challenge,
people keep thinking about it. It is the purpose of 
<a href="https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/publication/graphx-grades/">GraphX</a>
which reduces the processing time for the Page Rank algorithm
on a <a href="http://spark.apache.org/">Spark</a> environment.
It is not as fast as <a href="http://graphlab.org/projects/source.html">PowerGraph</a>
which is not based on Map/Reduce but it is must faster than 
<a href="https://mahout.apache.org/">Mahout</a> (see paper
<a href="https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/grades-graphx_with_fonts.pdf">GraphX: A Resilient Distributed Graph System on Spark</a>).
One fact, the language <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/index.html">Scala</a> appears more and more.
A sign: <a href="https://mahout.apache.org/">Mahout</a> recently took the 
decision to stop implementing machine learning algorithm against
Map/Reduce to switch to <a href="http://spark.apache.org/">Spark</a>.
