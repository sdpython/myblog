<p>
I began to test my modules against Python 3.5.
As I used virtual environement, I discover the following 
issue : 
<a href="https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/796">virtualenv fails with Python 3.5 on Windows</a>.
Surprisingly, it works on another machine probably due to the different
set of softwares installed on it.
I guess I'll wait a little bit before digging into it or trying to fix it on my own.
