I was surprised to see that a module
I develop to produce my teaching materials
gets downloaded 14k times last month on PiPy
(<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyquickhelper">pyquickhelper</a>).
It seems a lot... But if I count that Travis downloads it everytime
I commit something on GitHub. I did 50 commits last week.
I would say that the number of time I manually download this module is not significant
compare to the number of times it gets automatically downloaded.
It seems difficult to get a sense of those counts given by PiPy.
