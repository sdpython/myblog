<!-- SUMMARY BEGINS -->

<p>
Here are a few tricks I discovered when I implemented my first grammar
using <a href="http://www.antlr.org/">Antlr 4</a>.
First, it really helps to be able to test some parts
of your grammar. One of the options is the plugin
<a href="https://github.com/antlr/intellij-plugin-v4">IntelliJ Idea Plugin for ANTLR v4</a>
for the following tool:
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/">IntelliJ IDEA</a> (the plugin works
with the community edition, see also
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/help/installing-updating-and-uninstalling-repository-plugins.html#d777533e18545">Installing, Updating and Uninstalling Repository Plugins</a>).
You will find many grammar examples at <a href="https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4">antlr/grammars-v4</a>.
The tool tells you if the grammar compiles and when it cannot parse an example
as it displays a graphs with the recognized pieces.

<p>
There are three kinds of objects:
<ul>
<li><b>fragment:</b> (syntax: <tt>fragment [Name] : [definition] ;</tt>), it represents
    pieces of a grammar entity, they do not appear after a text was parsed
    as they do not mean anything by themselves.</li>
<li><b>token:</b> (syntax: <tt>[Name] : [definition] ;</tt>), it represents keywords,
    tokens, it should avoid ambiguity. For example, if a token (<i>+</i> for example)
    can have two meanings (unary, binary), these two meanings should be defined in two rules.</li>
<li><b>rule:</b> (syntax: <tt>[name] : [definition] ;</tt>), defines the grammar of the languages,
Antlr offers then the possibility to walk through the identified rules.</li>
</ul>
About the syntax, <tt>[Name]</tt> means the name must begin by an upper letter,
<tt>[name]</tt>, it must begin by a lower letter. All objects are defined with a syntax
very similar to regular expressions.
The grammar <a href="https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/blob/master/dot/DOT.g4">DOT</a> 
(<a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">graphviz</a> language)
is a simple example to begin with. We can see that:

<ul>
<li>The objects appears from the most complex first to the most simple at the end of the grammar.</li>
<li>The file ends with the rule: <tt>WS : [ \t\n\r]+ -&gt; skip ;</tt> which means that if a space
could not be matched by a previous rule, it should be skipped. Spaces are 
implicitely considered as separators.</li>
<li>The file begins with <tt>grammar DOT;</tt> where <tt>DOT</tt> is the name of the grammar.</li>
<li>The example <a href="https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/blob/master/java/Java.g4">Java.g4</a>
contains a main rule <tt>compilationUnit: packageDeclaration? importDeclaration* typeDeclaration* EOF ;</tt>.
<tt>EOF</tt> means the end of file. It forces the grammar to parse the whole file.</li>
</ul>

This tells us more about how Antlr tries to match the rule with the text 
(not sure I'm right about this): 
it tries rules in the order they are defined by the grammar, 
it stops searching whenever it finds a token
or a fragment (ambiguity is not possible for fragments and tokens).
I went through many mistakes when building my first grammar. One of them was looking that way:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
line 1:0 mismatched input 'aa' expecting {'something', 'aa'}
</pre>

<p>
As you noticed <tt>'aa'</tt> was expected but not matched. 
It was usually due to some ambiguity. To detect the conflict,
With the plugin mentioned above, 
I checked the rule the string rule was supposed to match (it fails),
I removed all rules above, it usually worked. By adding them back one by one
in the grammar, it became easier to understand where the conflict was.
</p>
<p>
On Python, I added function to module
<a href="http://www.xavierdupre.fr/app/pyensae/helpsphinx/index.html">pyensae</a> to build and use Antlr4 grammar.
See <a href="http://www.xavierdupre.fr/app/pyensae/helpsphinx/pyensae/languages/antlr_grammar_build.html">antlr_grammar_build.py</a>,
