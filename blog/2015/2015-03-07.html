Sometimes, a machine learned model does not get it. It does not 
find any way to properly classify the data. 
Sometimes, you know it could work better with another model
but it cannot be trained on such an amount of data.
So what...
</p>
<p>
Another direction consists in looking for non linear combinations
of existing features which could explain better the border
between two classes. Let's consider this known difficult example:
</p>

</p>

<p>
It cannot be linearly separated but it can with others kinds of models
(k-NN, SVC). However, by adding simple multiplications between existing features,
the problem becomes linear:

<p>
The point is: if you know that a complex features would really help
your model, it is worth spending time implementing it rather that
trying to approximating it by using a more complex model.
