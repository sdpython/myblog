Some errors can be very annoying sometimes if they come 
back again and again. Here is one of them:
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/issues/detail?id=623">TortoiseGit locks repository folders so that the user can't delete them</a>
which I throught was caused by Jenkins. So annoying that
it was mentioned in a couple of issues
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/issues/detail?id=401">401</a>,
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/issues/detail?id=497">497</a>,
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/issues/detail?id=1880">1880</a>.
I could avoid using TortoiseGit but that's the only git GUI
I don't have to remember the usage.
</p>

<p>
So let's tweak the <a href="https://tortoisegit.org/docs/tortoisegit/tgit-dug-settings.html">TortoiseGit's Settings</a>
even if some changes seem to fix it:
<pre>
TGitCache now checks file sizes before checking file contents. 
This should mitigate possible "file is locked" problems.
TGitCache now does not check the contents of files with filesize > 10 MiB any more
and falls back to checking the timestamp of the files (as if TGitCacheCheckContent
is set to "false") according the the git index. This limit can be changed by adjusting
TGitCacheCheckContentMaxSize (measured in KiB) in TortoiseGit advanced settings.
The reason for this change is that libgit2 reads a file to memory for hashing and,
thus, locking the file and the repository for this time span.
</pre>
</p>
<p>
A couple of tricks:
<ul>
<li>Set the Overlay status to both "Shell" and "Shell extended"</li>
<li>kill TGitCache.exe</li>
</ul>
</p>
