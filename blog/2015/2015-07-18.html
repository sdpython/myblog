A decade ago, France stopped nuclear weapons testing and
replaced them by simulations. I guess it now happens in virtual
environment. Researchers starts to do the same with robots:

<a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2015/06/minecraft">Using Minecraft to unboggle the robot mind</a>.
We do not need to actually build a robot to create a kind of artificial intelligence.
It can just be developped in a virtual environment such as Minecraft
and interact it with a python module such as 
<a href="http://picraft.readthedocs.org/en/release-0.3/index.html">picraft</a>.
We could try to build a robot which learns how to build a house which does not collapse.
