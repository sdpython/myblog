Internet of Things is a way to say that every object can be connected to
each others and to you. We will be soon able to command many daily objects
(fridge, table, bed, ...) from anywhere with a smartphone.
They will be even able to take simple decisions for you such 
as ordering food which is missing from your fridge or
started to warm your flat just because your smartphone
is heading to your home. And it will be doable in Python:
