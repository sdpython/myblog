I publish my teaching material as python module.
I added some tricks to made that happen. Recently, I was wondering
how to add some kind of blog posts inside the documentation.
As I have several teaching going on, I did not want to merge
all blog posts into a single one where students would have to 
filter out what blog post is meant for them.
So I thought about using a kind of blog generator written in Python
on the top of Sphinx.
I went through that blog post 
<a href="http://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-available-static-blog-website-generator-in-Python">What's the best available static blog/website generator in Python?</a>
which gives a short list of them. It is possible to check their popularity
by looking at 
<a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">Top Open-Source Static Site Generators</a>.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to follow the same design for my blog, same pattern. So I was looking for a 
tool generated RST files and not directly HTML.
<a href="http://tinkerer.me/">Tinkerer</a> seemed a good choice.
Should I have to add the message <i>powered by Tinkerer</i> as every site
using it is displaying that sentance? I also looked into
<a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.5.0/">Pelican</a>,
<a href="http://getnikola.com/">nykola</a>.
I also found a very simple one with a French name:
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/jibalamy/eclaircie">Ã©Claircie</a>.
</p>
<p>
I finally decided to write some code to process my own blog posts and to insert them
in the documentation of a an existing python module.
It is not finalized yet but it looks like that:
<a href="http://www.xavierdupre.fr/app/pyquickhelper/helpsphinx/blog/2015/2015-04-04_first_blogpost.html">An example of a blog post included in the documentation</a>.
This process forces me to dig into <a href="http://sphinx-doc.org/extdev/">sphinx devext API</a>
which I do not fully understand yet.
It is quite difficult to find good examples on the web.
What I have implemented is available here:
<a href="https://github.com/sdpython/pyquickhelper/tree/master/src/pyquickhelper/helpgen">pyquickhelper.helpgen</a>.
</p>
<p>
By implementing my own blog, I cannot have all the features the static generators have
(good templating, many languages). I spent most of my time in implementing the blog post aggregations
(categories, months) and the splitting (not more than 10 blog posts per pages). 
But now, if I want to customize Sphinx a little bit, it is easier.
