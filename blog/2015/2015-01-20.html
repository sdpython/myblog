It is tempting to do everything from a 
<a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html">IPython notebook</a> such
as downloading a file from DropBox. On the web interface, when a user
click on a file, a button <i>Download</i> shows up. A second click on this
button and the file will be downloaded it. To retrieve the file from
a notebook, the url of the page which contains the button but it is close
from the good one. This leads to the following example:
</p>

<pre class="brush: py">
url = "https://www.dropbox.com/[something]/[filename]?dl=1"  # dl=1 is important
import urllib.request
u = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
data = u.read()
u.close()

with open([filename], "wb") as f :
    f.write(data)
</pre>

<p>
It first downloads the data as bytes and then stores 
everything into a file.
