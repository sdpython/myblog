<p>
I received of couple of daily mails from social networks or
diffusion list. I usually read them on my mobile phone
in the subway... They recently became bigger, not the content, just the 
formatting... and 
they get cut by my phone. If I want to read them, I need to click to download
the end of them. I'm in the subway so it is very slow. I usually give up.
In fact, I always give up. As a result, instead of giving me nicer emails,
the web site which send them to me gives me truncated emails.
