<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29">Python</a> 
was conceived in 1990 (source Wikidepia). Not so young maybe compare to 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_%28programming_language%29">R</a> which is in fact
younger but inspired from a much older language 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_%28programming_language%29">S</a> born around 1975.
Why bringing back this question when every data scientist knows both,
when universities teach both? Difficult to say which one
is best according to <a href="https://github.com/hadley/r-python">R and python usages</a>.
According to 
<a href="http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/07/github-special-data-scientists-to-follow-best-tutorials/">Top Data Scientists to Follow &amp; Best Data Science Tutorials on GitHub</a>,
Python seems to be more popular among the top data scientist on GitHub.
But is there any competition?

So...
</p>
<p>
Every data scientist is using both language but all of them
are using mostly one. Then a former student told me that little story.
His company was using R as a preferred language but as new hires joined,
Python became more and more popular. I was thinking maybe we should
compare the average age of people mostly using one or the other.
