<p>
Common rules, common formats, documentation, small steps,
unit tests, it seems obvious to many and not that obvious 
for every who tried to put that in practice.
Some inspiration: <a href="https://www.practicereproducibleresearch.org/">The Practice of Reproducible Research</a>
(or the <a href="https://legacy.gitbook.com/book/bids/the-practice-of-reproducible-research/details">PDF</a>).
To my opinion, reproducible research is not a goal, it is a need.
