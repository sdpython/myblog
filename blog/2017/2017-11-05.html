<a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> is widely used by data scientists.
It is one of the modules which contributed a lot to the Python ecosystem to manipulate data.
It is not perfect, a dataset takes in memory three times the space it takes on disk
in average and reading a couple of gigabytes is necessarily fast. However,
a couple of gigabytes is not enough to think about stronger approaches such 
parallelization (<a href="https://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/">dask</a>, ...) but with a little bit of overhead
for such size. All I wanted was the same functionalities as <i>pandas</i>
but implemented in a streaming way. No need to load the whole datasets in memory,
no need to wait for the data to be fully loaded in memory. That's why I started
<a href="http://www.xavierdupre.fr/app/pandas_streaming/helpsphinx/index.html">pandas_streaming</a>.

<pre class="brush: py">
import pandas
df = pandas.DataFrame([dict(cf=0, cint=0, cstr="0"),
                       dict(cf=1, cint=1, cstr="1"),
                       dict(cf=3, cint=3, cstr="3")])

from pandas_streaming.df import StreamingDataFrame
sdf = StreamingDataFrame.read_df(df)

for df in sdf:
    # process this chunk of data
    # df is a dataframe
    print(df)
</pre>
<p>
The module will continue to grow probably not as fast as I would like it to.
