<!-- SUMMARY BEGINS -->

<p>
Git repositories always get bigger. I noticed than
one of GitHub repository was above 500Mb. I was wondering how 
I could make that size smaller. First, let see the size.
</p>
<pre>
git count-objects -v 
</pre>
<pre>
count: 0
size: 0
in-pack: 19644
packs: 1
size-pack: 222397
prune-packable: 0
garbage: 0
size-garbage: 0
</pre>
<p>
The size is <i>size-pack</i>. To clean,
the first option is to rebase
the repository so basically to clean everything and to commit 
the current state of the content. One solution is to keep only 
the latest commits (see <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/reduce-repository-size-321848262.html">Reduce repository size</a>). 
</p>
<pre>
git log -n N
git reset --hard HEAD~N
git push --force 
</pre>

<!-- SUMMARY ENDS -->

<p>
If this does not work, another 
strategy is to create an empty branch, to commit
everything as the first commit, to delete the master branch,
to replace it by the new one and to clean unused files
(see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9683279/make-the-current-commit-the-only-initial-commit-in-a-git-repository">Make the current commit the only (initial) commit in a Git repository?</a>).
</p>
<pre>
git checkout --orphan newBranch
git add -A                      # Add all files and commit them
git commit
git branch -D master            # Deletes the master branch
git branch -m master            # Rename the current branch to master
git push -f origin master       # Force push master branch to github
git gc --aggressive --prune=all # Remove the old files
</pre>

<p>
A third option is to remove files added to the repository and then deleted.
To do that, you need to follow the steps described into:
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository/">Removing sensitive data from a repository</a>.
That leaves the problem of finding files you can remove.
