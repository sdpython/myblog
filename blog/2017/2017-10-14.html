I was doing some research on some other topic but I found
this javascript library
<a href="https://github.com/OpenMined/filbert">filbert</a>
which parses and converts a Python script into a javascript script.
The output is quite verbose but follows the syntactic tree
produced by the parser. 
<a href="https://github.com/QQuick/Transcrypt">Transcrypt</a>
is less verbose.
I then became curious about
<a href="http://pyjs.org/">pyjs</a> which I saw in a conference.
It did not get any update in two years so it seems to be discontinued
but <a href="http://brython.info/demo.html?lang=fr">Brython</a>
is still alive and seems a better tool to run python from a javascript
page. I also discovered <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyduktape">pyduketape</a>
which wraps in Python a javascript engine. It is a different approach from
the one followed by <a href="http://jeanphix.me/Ghost.py/">ghost.py</a>
which is relying on <a href="http://pyside.github.io/docs/pyside/">PySide</a>.
